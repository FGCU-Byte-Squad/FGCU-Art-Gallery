# FGCU Dataverse

The files in this section of the FGCU Art Gallery repository comprise of the Art Gallery prototype made with Figma Make. This was done to be able to display the API calls made to the FGCU Dataverse database on a front-end and therefore done for testing purposes ONLY. The real front-end part of this project should be under https://github.com/FGCU-Byte-Squad/FGCU-Art-Gallery/tree/main/front-end.
